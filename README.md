# Peg (Practice Exam Generator)

**Project Overview**
-------------------

Peg is an online platform designed to help students prepare for their
exams by generating personalized practice questions based on class materials
like PDFs or slides.

**Objective**
------------

The primary objective of this project is to develop a system that can
automatically generate practice questions from uploaded class materials,
allowing students to engage in self-paced learning and improve their
understanding of concepts.

**Functional Requirements**
-------------------------

### Practice Exam Generation

* Users (Students) can upload class materials (PDFs or slides) to the
  platform.
* The system generates personalized questions based on the uploaded material.
* Users can select the subject and difficulty level for each exam.

### Question Generation

* Questions are generated using a combination of Generative AI technology like Llama.
* Questions cover various concepts related to the selected subject.
* (Optional) Difficulty levels are classified as easy, medium, or hard.

### (Optional) Personalized Learning Path

* The system provides a personalized learning path for each user based on their
  performance and learning style.

**Technical Requirements**
-------------------------

### Front-end Technology

* The platform will use a modern front-end framework (React) for
  client-side rendering.

### Back-end Technology

* The system will utilize a Node.js-based back-end with Express.js as the web
  server.
* Database management will be handled using MongoDB.

### Artificial Intelligence
* Llama 3 Model (Customized Prompts)

### APIs and Integrations

* APIs will be designed to follow standard RESTful architecture guidelines.

**Success Metrics**
-------------------

The success of this project will be measured by:

* User adoption rates and engagement metrics.
* Feedback from users and educators on the effectiveness of the platform.
* Comparison of user results with national or international exam standards.
