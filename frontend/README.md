# PEG Frontend
The PEG frontend accepts PDFs or class slides and sends them to a backend service.
When the browser receives a response from the backend, it displays problem sets one by one
in a well-formatted style.

## Generated Pages
- Index Page: Users can drag and drop a file on this page to upload
- Question Page: Users can study with problem sets displayed one at a time
- Feedback Page: Users can review which questions they answered correctly or incorrectly, along with the right answers

## Expected Effects
- Students can generate as many problem sets as they want before taking an actual exam
- Students can engage in a simulated exam environment, leading to improvement in their academic performance
